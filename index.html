      <h2 class="cooltext">About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I’m a passionate software and game developer with a love for creativity and problem-solving. My journey into game development started with my obsession with Terraria, a game that got me hooked on the idea of building worlds and experiences through code. Programming quickly became my favorite way to express creativity, and I haven’t stopped since. I am fluent in C++, Python, and GDscript, from Godot. I also enjoy messing around with Python, and working with Rasberry Pis. Over time, I have gotten into creating 2d pixel art, to compliment my game-making knowledge.
</p>
      <p>I love working with other people, I do my best in teams where we can share ideas, get feedback, and solve problems together. One of my proudest moments was winning 3rd place in the Gamedev.js Jam with a game that had AI-driven NPC dialogue and backend servers. I tackle challenges with a creative mindset, learning by doing and coming up with unique solutions when deadlines are tight. Whether I’m making Python scripts or building something big in C++, I’m all about trying new tools and pushing what’s possible. My dream is to become a software engineer. While I can do my own thing, I can’t wait to be part of a team creating games and software that inspire people everywhere.</p>
