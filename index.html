      <h2 class="cooltext">About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I’m a pasionate software and game devloper with a love for creativity and problem-solving. My journey into game development started with my obsession with Terraria, a game that got me hooked on the idea of building worlds and experiences through code. Programming quickly became my favorite way to express creativity, and I haven’t stopped since. I’m into web design, C++, and I’ve got solid experience with GDevelop, plus some hands-on time in Godot. I also like messing around with Python and working on Raspberry Pi projects, from useful scripts to cool games. Over time, I’ve gotten into creating 2D pixel art, which makes my games feel extra personal.
</p>
      <p>I love working with other people, I do my best in teams where we can share ideas, get feedback, and solve problems together. One of my proudest moments was winning 3rd place in the Gamedev.js Jam with a game that had AI-driven NPC dialogue and backend servers. I tackle challenges with a creative mindset, learning by doing and coming up with unique solutions when deadlines are tight. Whether I’m making Python scripts or building something big in C++, I’m all about trying new tools and pushing what’s possible. My dream is to join a game dev studio and work on awesome projects with talented teams. While I can do my own thing, I can’t wait to be part of a team creating games that inspire people everywhere.</p>
